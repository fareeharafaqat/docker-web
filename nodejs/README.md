# Node.js application development

Launch the application in debug mode:

1. Run `docker-compose up` to launch `index.js` using Nodemon.
1. Open <http://localhost:3000/> in a browser. Or add a name to the path, e.g. <http://localhost:3000/Craig>
1. Edit `index.js` and Nodemon will restart the application.
1. Debuggers can also be attached to the process at `localhost:9229`.

Press `Ctrl|Cmd + C` to stop Docker Compose.
